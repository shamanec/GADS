## Introduction

* GADS is a web UI for remote control of devices provisioned by [GADS-devices-provider](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS-devices-provider).

**NB** New React based UI - work in progress

## Features
1. Authentication  
  a. Log in, session expiry  
  b. Add users (for admins)  
2. Devices control (most of interaction is wrapped around Appium API)
  * Android
    - [GADS-Android-stream](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS-Android-stream) video stream  
  * iOS
    - [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent) video stream   
  * Both
    - Basic functionalities - Home, Lock, Unlock, Type text
    - Basic remote control - tap, swipe, touch&hold
    - Take high quality screenshots
    - Reservation - loading a device sets it `In use` and can't be used by another person until it is released
    - Appium session refresh mechanism if a session timed out or was closed

Developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Windows 10, macOS Ventura 13.5.1  

## TODO
* Basic browser Appium inspector
* Provider and devices log display
* Extend features - better administration, more control options - e.g. simulate location

## Setup
Currently the project assumes that GADS UI, MongoDB, Selenium Grid and device providers are on the same network. They can all be on the same machine as well.  

### Deps
1. Install Go version 1.21.0 or higher
2. Install Node > 16.

#### Start a MongoDB instance
##### Install Docker 
1. You need to have Docker(Docker Desktop on macOS, Windows) installed.  

##### Start MongoDB in a docker container
1. Execute `docker run -d --restart=always --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0`. This will pull the official MongoDB 6.0 image from Docker Hub and start a container binding ports `27017` for the MongoDB instance.  
2. You can use MongoDB Compass or another tool to access the db if needed.

##### Note
You can potentially use any other way you prefer to create a MongoDB instance, doesn't have to be Docker in particular

### Setup the GADS UI
Clone the project code from the repo.

#### Build the UI
1. Open the `gads-ui` folder in Terminal.
2. Execute `npm install`
3. Execute `npm run build`

#### Start the UI and backend service
1. Open terminal and execute `go build .` in the main project folder  
2. Execute `./GADS` providing the following flags:
  a. `--auth=` - true/false to enable actual authentication (default is `false`)
  b. `--host-address=` - local IP address of the host machine, e.g. `192.168.1.6` (default is `localhost`, I would advise against using the default value)
  c. `--port=` - port on which the UI and backend service will run (default is `10000`)
  d. `--mongo-db=` - address and port of the MongoDB instance, e.g `192.168.1.6:27017` (default is `localhost:27017`)
  e. `--admin-username=` - username of the default admin user (default is `admin`)
  f. `--admin-password=` - password of the default admin user (default is `password`)
  g. `--admin-email=` - email of the default admin user (default is `admin@gads.ui`)
3. Access the UI on `http://{host-address}:{port}`

#### Add new provider config
1. Log in with an admin user.
2. Go to the `Admin` section
3. Open `Providers administration`
4. On the `New provider` tab fill in all needed data and save.
5. You should see a new provider tab. You can now start up a provider instance using the new configuration.

#### UI development
If you want to work on the UI you need to add a proxy in `package.json` to point to the Go backend 
1. Open the `gads-ui` folder.
2. Open the `package-json` file.
3. Add a new field `"proxy": "http://192.168.1.28:10000/"` providing the host and port of the Go backend service.
4. Run `npm start`

#### Start a provider instance
This is only the UI, to actually have devices available you need to have at least one [GADS-devices-provider](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS-devices-provider) instance running on the same host(or another host on the same network) that will actually set up and provision devices. Follow the setup steps in the linked repository to create a provider instance. You can have multiple provider instances on different hosts providing devices.
