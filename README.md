  üöÄ **Self-Hosted Device Farm & Test Automation Platform** - Alternative to AWS Device Farm and Firebase Test Lab for Mobile & Smart TV Testing
</div>

## üéØ What is GADS?

**GADS** is a free, open-source device farm platform that enables **remote device control** and **Appium test execution** on mobile devices (iOS/Android) and smart TVs (currently supporting Samsung Tizen OS and LG WebOS). Perfect for QA teams, mobile developers, and organizations looking for a self-hosted alternative to expensive cloud testing services like AWS Device Farm and Firebase Test Lab.

The platform architecture consists of two main components:
- **Hub**: A web interface for remote device control and provider management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ### **Prerequisites**
> Before getting started, make sure you have the following:
> - A **MongoDB** instance (v6.0 recommended)
> - Network connectivity between Hub, Providers, MongoDB, and Selenium Grid
> ---

### ‚ö° Quick Start

#### Option 1: Download the latest binary

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS/releases) and download the latest binary for your platform.

#### Option 2: Build from source for non-UI related development
**IMPORTANT** You can freely use the Go code to your ends or provide new features/bug fixes on mainstream project but any changes to the UI should be requested from the core team.  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shamanec/GADS

# Build the application without UI
cd ../..
go build .
```

#### Option 3: Build from source for UI related development
**IMPORTANT** You can freely use the Go code to your ends or provide new features/bug fixes on mainstream project but any changes to the UI should be requested from the core team.  

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamanec/GADS
```
2. Download the prebuilt UI files zip from the latest [release](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS/releases)
3. Unzip the file from step into your GADS folder in a new folder named `hub-ui`, your folder structure should look like `../GADS/hub-ui/build/*`
4. Build the application
```bash
cd ../..
go build -tags ui .
```
> **Note**: Optionally before building you can update the docs.go (OpenAPI spec) by running `swag init -g hub/hub.go -o docs`

### üõ†Ô∏è Common setup
#### üå± MongoDB
The project uses MongoDB for storing logs and for synchronization of some data between hub and providers.
You can either run MongoDB in a docker container:  
- You need to have Docker(Docker Desktop on macOS, Windows) installed.
- Execute `docker run -d --restart=always --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0`. This will pull the official MongoDB 6.0 image from Docker Hub and start a container binding ports `27017` for the MongoDB instance.
- You can use MongoDB Compass or another tool to access the db if needed.

or  
- Start MongoDB instance in the way you prefer

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Hub setup
For detailed instructions on setting up the Hub, refer to the [Hub Setup Docs](./docs/hub.md)  

#### üì± Provider setup
For detailed instructions on setting up the Provider, refer to the [Provider Setup Docs.](./docs/provider.md)

## Running GADS as a System Service
To ensure that GADS runs continuously and can be managed easily, it is recommended to execute it as a service on your operating system. Running GADS as a service allows it to start automatically on boot, restart on failure, and be managed through standard service commands.

### üêß Linux
For detailed instructions on how to create a service for Linux using systemd, please refer to the [Linux Service Documentation](./docs/linux-service.md).

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows
For detailed instructions on how to create a service for Windows using WinSW, please refer to the [Windows Service Documentation](./docs/windows-service.md).

### üçè macOS
*Note: Service implementation for macOS is yet to be documented.*

|[go-ios](https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios)| Many thanks for creating this CLI tool to communicate with iOS devices, perfect for installing/reinstalling and running WebDriverAgentRunner without Xcode |
|[Appium](https://github.com/appium)| It would be impossible to control the devices remotely without Appium for the control and WebDriverAgent for the iOS screen stream, kudos!                         |
